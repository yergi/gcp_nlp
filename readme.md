# NLP Classification Example

This is a basic wrapper around Google Cloud Platform's NLP capabilities.

The functions in this package are general enough to be applied to any text dataset
that is formatted appropriately for ingestion into GCP. Further enhancements
could allow for automated imports from an outside data source, as well as applying
and storing a completed model's predictions to an outside data source.

**Note:** Set up of a GCP account and proper storage of credentials as described
in [this help document](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/automl/docs/before-you-begin) 
is required for this package to work.

*TODO:* Add tests
